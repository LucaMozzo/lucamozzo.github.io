<h1 class="western">Skills</h1>
<p>I'm continuously improving my skills. Here are most of them as far
    as I remember (the ones I remember are usually the most important and
    advanced).</p>
<p><b>IT and related</b></p>
<ul>
    <li><p style="font-weight: normal"><u>C#</u> and <u>Java</u> are
        surely the programming languages I know better. There's only one
        difference: they taught me how to program in Java, but not in C#. As
        you'll see below, most of my skills are self-taught.</p>
    <li><p style="font-weight: normal"><span style="text-decoration: none">Recently
	I've been playing around with </span><u>C</u><span style="text-decoration: none">.
	I believe it's a must-have in order to understand how a computer
	works. I'm now reading a 800-pages book to understand the useful
	low-level features of it.</span></p>
    <li><p style="font-weight: normal"><span style="text-decoration: none">A
	little bit of </span><u>Assembly</u><span style="text-decoration: none">
	and assembling in </span><u>HEX</u><span style="text-decoration: none">
	and </span><u>binary</u><span style="text-decoration: none">, a
	topic I really enjoyed at uni.</span></p>
    <li><p style="font-weight: normal"><u>SQL</u><span style="text-decoration: none">
	is my most recent skill. I'm looking forward to learning it really
	deeply for at least one DBMS. At the moment I'm using MySQL
	(University), IBM DB2 and MS SQL Server (home).</span></p>
    <li><p style="font-weight: normal"><span style="text-decoration: none">As
	a part of my early experiments in programming I know </span><u>Visual
        Basic</u><span style="text-decoration: none"> .NET, some VB6 that I
	had to learn to make an Excel macro, </span><u>Lightswitch</u><span style="text-decoration: none">
	(reaaally fun, but I didn't have any application to which apply it,
	therefore </span><span style="text-decoration: none">soon I left it)
	and other minor skills that at the moment I don't actually remember.</span></p>
    <li><p style="font-weight: normal"><span style="text-decoration: none">People
	don't include it any more at some point, but... ECDL certified. I
	got certified for using MS Office 2007 and Windows XP. And I'm
	really keen with Windows: speed-up, administration, registry and
	more. I know Linux too.</span></p>
</ul>
<p><b><span style="text-decoration: none">Other skills</span></b></p>
<ul>
    <li><p style="font-weight: normal"><span style="text-decoration: none">I
	had to put </span><u>Electronics</u><span style="text-decoration: none">
	in this section because I'm still interested in it but it's
	something people aren't looking for. However studying it at high
	school gave me a valuable help in understanding the hardware side of
	the world.</span></p>
    <li><p style="font-weight: normal"><span style="text-decoration: none">Languages</span></p>
        <ul>
            <li><p style="font-weight: normal"><span style="text-decoration: none">English:
		good enough</span></p>
            <li><p style="font-weight: normal"><span style="text-decoration: none">Italian:
		native speaker</span></p>
        </ul>
</ul>
