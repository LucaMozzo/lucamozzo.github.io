							<h3><b>Technical skills</b></h3>
							<p>
								<ul>
									<li><b>C#</b> and <b>Java</b> are
										surely the programming languages I know better. My Java learning path is for sure the most complete,
										as I've taught at Uni. However I've been using C# for more than 3 years now, so it shouldn't be that bad.
										I also used C# to develop <b>Windows Phone 8.1 apps</b>.</li>
									<li>Recently
										I've been playing around with <b>C</b> and <b>C++</b>.
										I believe they're really useful in order to understand how a computer
										works. I'm reading a book introducing most aspects of C and the differences with C++, which is showing me
										how it can be useful to use them in some situations. I've also used them for microprocessors and Arduino programming.</li>
									<li>I like doing some low-level programming, that's why I learnt a little bit of <b>Assembly</b> (also as a part of a module at Uni).
										Although I never experimented it with x86 architecture, I believe it's really useful for understanding how a computer actually works.</li>
									<li>I found <b>SQL</b> really interesting 
										and I use it mostly with a local database for storing applications data or websites credentials. At the moment I'm using MySQL
										(University), IBM DB2 and SQLite, but I still have a lot to learn about it. I also know <i>relational database</i> concepts.</li>
									<li>As
										a part of my early experiments in programming I know <b>Visual
										Basic .NET</b>, some VB6 that I
										had to learn to make an Excel macro to make computations on exported data from a software for my father's company, I tried <b>Lightswitch</b>
										and I found really fun, but because I didn't have much applications to make, I gave up soon.
										</li>
										<li>Although <b>web development</b> is not myfavourite field, I'm pretty much autonomous and I managed to do whatever I needed to do so far.
										I learnt web development entirely at hackathons, and now that I have decent skills, I'm using it for some projects. I know <b>HTML</b>,<b>CSS</b>,
										<b>PHP</b>,<b>Javascript</b>,<b>JQuery</b>,<b>MeteorJS</b> and recently I've beeen learning <b>NodeJS</b> with <b>Express</b>.
										</li>
									<li>People
										don't include it any more at some point, but... ECDL certified. I
										got certified using MS Office 2007 and Windows XP. And I'm
										really keen with Windows: speed-up, administration, registry and
										more. I know Linux too.</li>
								</ul>
							</p>
							<h3><b>Language skills</b></h3>
							<p>
								<ul>
									<li><b>Italian</b> - native speaker</li>
									<li><b>English</b> - advanced/professional level</li>
									<li><b>Russian</b> - basic level</li>
								</ul>
