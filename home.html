    <h1>Hello, folks!</h1>
    <p>Let me introduce myself, I'll just say a couple of things you may find interesting...</p>
    <img src="" alt="myphoto" />
    <p>I'm a 19-year-old Italian student. I studied Electronics an Systems and Automation at secondary school in Italy, then I moved
        to London. I've been studying Computer Science with Intelligent Systems at King's College London since September 2015.

    <blockquote>This way is too boring. Just give me another chance...</blockquote>
    <p>I have too many interests, and this often means making decisions about what to choose. I like artificial intelligence, security,
         cryptography, electronics and algorithms, all topped with some programming of course. I'm not going to say <strong>which</strong> 
         programming languages I'm particularly confident with, unless you actually want to <a href="#">take a look</a> to them.</p>
