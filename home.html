    <p>I'm <strong>Luca Mozzo</strong>, a 19-year-old Italian student. At the moment I'm
        pursuing a BSc degree in Computer Science and Intelligent Systems at
        King's College London.</p>
    <p>I studied Electronics at high school and, although I changed my
        major for uni, I don't regret that choice.</p>
    <p>I'm obsessed with knowledge. My to-do list is infinite, therefore
        I try, even struggling, to do everything step by step.</p>
    <p>Fasten the seat belt and get ready for a massive list of things I
        planned to do by the end of the Summer (or future plans):</p>
    <ul>
        <li><p>Improve my C skills</p>
        <li><p>Improve my Python skills</p>
        <li><p>Learn data mining</p>
        <li><p>Become keen with at least a DMBS</p>
        <li><p>Learn algorithms. Lots of them</p>
        <li><p>Get a C2 grade A in English</p>
        <li><p>Graduate with 1:1 and at least 90%</p>
        <li><p>Master C# and VB .NET</p>
    </ul>
    <p>You may be wondering why the hell I wrote all this stuff here.
        Well, I admit that my desire of achieving those results is strong and
        motivates me a lot. Therefore they are important for me now. Short
        term goals see more progress and as a result you're more motivated.
    </p>
    <p>Now you know that I am also a “motivation hacker”. I'm always
        looking for a mindset that would allow me to concentrate for hours
        and hence, learning massive amounts of information without feeling
        the fatigue.</p>
    <p>That's it for now, check out the other sections for more.</p>
